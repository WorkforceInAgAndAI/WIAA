Some of the most used sensors are RGB cameras, multispectral cameras, hyperspectral cameras, thermal cameras, and LiDAR sensors. But how are these sensors useful and what is the difference between each sensor?

## RGB Camera

- Captures red, green, blue light reflectance
- Produces images similar to what your eyes see
- **Use:** General field scouting, visual assessment
- This is a type of passive sensor because it detects light that it did not produce

## Multispectral Camera

- Detects of 6 to 10 sensors that detect light reflected from specific broad areas of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Often is used to see red, green, blue, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance
- **Use:** Calculating plant health indices

## Hyperspectral Camera

- Detects light reflected from hundreds of narrow areas of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Often is used to see red, green, blue, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance
- **Use:** Calculating plant health indices
- If an RGB camera is like listening to a song with 3 instruments, a hyperspectral camera is like listening to a song played by a giant orchestra

## Thermal Camera

- Does not measure the amount of light reflected from an object, but rather it measures heat reflected or released from an object
- **Use:** Water stress detection

## LiDAR Sensor

- Uses lasers to measure the distance between the object and the sensor
- Creates 3D maps
- **Use:** Terrain mapping, canopy height measurement
