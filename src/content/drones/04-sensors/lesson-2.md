## Sensors Can Give Us Data, But What Do We Do With That Data?

Multispectral cameras can be used to determine the health of a plant. Often multispectral cameras contain sensors that capture light reflected in the blue, green, red, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR) areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.

## Key Principle

Plants that are **healthier** reflect **more NIR light** while **stressed** plants reflect **less NIR light**.

**Healthy** plants also reflect **less red light** than **stressed** plants.

The reflectance of light in these two regions of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to determine the relative health of different plants in a field.
