Different drone types are suited for different agricultural applications.

## Single Rotor (1 rotor)

- **Best for:** High payloads
- Can carry heavier sensors and equipment
- More efficient for large payloads

## Quadcopter (4 rotors)

- **Best for:** Mapping fields
- Most common type for agriculture
- Good balance of maneuverability and stability
- Easy to fly and maintain

## Hexacopter (6 rotors)

- **Best for:** Provides extra lift
- More stable than quadcopters
- Can continue flying if one motor fails
- Better for larger sensors

## Fixed Wing (airplane-like)

- **Best for:** Large fields and farms
- Covers more area per flight
- Longer flight times
- Requires runway or launch system

## Fixed Wing VTOL (airplane-like with vertical takeoff)

- **Best for:** Restricted runway space
- Combines benefits of fixed wing and multirotor
- Vertical takeoff and landing capability
- Long-range coverage
