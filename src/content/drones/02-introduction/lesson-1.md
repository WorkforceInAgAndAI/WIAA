A drone is a flying robot that can be controlled by the user or programmed to fly on its own. In agriculture, drones help farmers see their fields from above and detect problems early.

## Two Important Terms

- **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle):** The drone itself
- **UAS (Unmanned Aerial System):** The drone + controller + sensors + pilot + software

From the ground, a field may look healthy. But from above, drones can reveal stressed areas, allowing farmers to:

1. Locate stressed areas in the field
2. Diagnose the cause of the stress
3. Quantify the amount of stress

Even fields that appear healthy at ground level may be losing significant amounts of money each year due to yield losses. Using specialized sensors to calculate vegetation indices provides a different perspective, enabling farmers to detect problems early, make informed decisions, and optimize crop performance.
