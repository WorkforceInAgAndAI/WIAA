Farmers and agriculturalists manage numerous tasks to grow a successful crop. Some require hand labor or traditional equipment like tractors, while others are increasingly suited to drone technology for greater efficiency and precision.

## Why Drones Matter in Agriculture

Drones equipped with sensors and cameras enable farmers to perform complex crop management tasks more efficiently and with greater accuracy than traditional methods.

## Drone Capabilities vs. Traditional Methods

Understanding which tasks drones can perform helps farmers make informed technology decisions.

**Manual & Traditional Tasks**
- Spreading fertilizers
- Spraying pesticides
- Removing off-types
- Operating tractors and combines
- Fixing machinery
- Planting seeds in rows
- Tillage and soil preparation

**Drone-Capable Tasks**
- Detecting insect outbreaks
- Soil texture mapping
- Detecting water stress
- Checking plant height
- Monitoring crop growth
- Scouting for weeds
- Measuring soil compaction
- Estimating crop yield
- Mapping field terrain
- Assessing storm damage

## Learning Activities

**Tasks of Agriculture Classification Exercise**
Categorize farming tasks based on whether they require manual labor, traditional equipment, drones, or a combination of technologies.

**Drone Technology Application**
Identify which agricultural tasks in your region would benefit most from drone technology and explain the advantages for each task.
