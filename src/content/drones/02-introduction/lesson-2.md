Farmers and agriculturalists have many tasks to complete to grow a successful crop. Some tasks require hand labor or equipment such as tractors. Other tasks can be completed using drones.

## How Drones Help Agriculture

Drones can be useful for manual tasks such as spreading fertilizers or spraying pesticides. When a drone is equipped with a sensor, the drone system can be useful for a wide variety of crop scouting tasks such as:

- Detecting pest outbreaks
- Estimating crop yield
- Mapping field conditions
- Monitoring plant health
- Identifying irrigation issues
- Assessing storm damage
