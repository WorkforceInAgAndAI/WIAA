    "options": [
      "Vision Model",
      "Classification Model",
      "Quantification Model",
      "Prediction Model"
    ],
    "correct": 2,

    "q": "When developing AI models, when is human-in-the-loop especially important?",
    "options": [
      "Data collection",
      "Labeling data",
      "Training the model",
      "Model testing"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explain": "Humans can use their domain expertise to label data accurately and precisely so the model is trained on quality data and is more likely to perform precisely and accurately in real-world conditions."
